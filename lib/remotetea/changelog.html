<h1>Change Log <q>Remote Tea</q></h1>

<p><a class="ext" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/remotetea/">Remote Tea
Project Home Page</a> on SourceForge.</p>

<h2>Version 1.1.1:</h2>

<p>This is a minor maintenance release.</p>

<h3>Reorganization of the project</h3>

<p>The project has been converted into a Maven project. It has become a multi-module project,
containing the modules <span class="product">oncrpc</span>, <span class="product">jrpcgen</span>,
<span class="product">jportmap</span>, <span class="product">maven-plugin</span> and
<span class="product">information</span>. The transition into a Maven project intends on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span>separating the project into its modules.</span></li>
  <li><span>deploying it to Maven central.</span></li>
  <li><span>introducing a Maven plugin for generating Java sources out of an x-file within the Maven life cycle phase <em>generate-sources</em>.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>However, the Ant-Build of Remote Tea is still supported and will at least get in charge
to create the release zip files, which will be continued to be uploaded to SourceForge.</p>

<h2>Version 1.1.0:</h2>

<p>This is a minor feature/maintenance release.</p>

<h3>New features</h3>

<h4>Client-side</h4>

<ul>
	<li><span>The ONC/RPC client stub implementation has been extended by the method <code>nullproc()</code> as a convenient way
	to launch null procedure calls.</span></li>
	<li><span>The instance of an ONC/RPC client stub implementation can now be bound to other ONC/RPC client instances during
	its lifetime via the method <code>setClient()</code>. Besides, a previously used ONC/RPC client instance will be closed by
	this method.</span></li>  
</ul>

<h4>Server-side</h4>

<ul>
	<li><span>With this release custom authentication schemes can be defined and registered to an ONC/RPC
	server stub.</span></li>
</ul>

<h4>jrpcgen</h4>

<ul>
	<li><div>jrpcgen considers and realizes the following new command line options on invocation:
	<table class="cli">
		<tr>
			<td>-t</td>
			<td>create TCP server only</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>-u</td>
			<td>create UDP server only</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>-noxdr</td>
			<td>do not create XDR datatype classes</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	</div></li>
</ul>

<h3>Maintenance</h3>

<h4>Server-side</h4>

<ul>
	<li><span>Authentication failures such as <em>bad credentials</em> and <em>bad verifier</em>
	within ONC/RPC authentication handling have not been reported back to clients, properly. Such authentication
	failures lead now to an appropriate	authentication failure reply to clients.</span></li>
</ul>

<h4>jrpcgen</h4>

<ul>
	<li><div>Consider the following quite legal definitions in an .x-file:
	<div>
<pre class="code">
struct MyStructure {
  int x;
  int y;
};

typedef struct MyStructure MyStructure;
</pre>
	</div>
	The <code>typedef</code> caused an error recognizing a duplicate identifier. Such a <code>typedef</code> is now
	recognized and silently ignored.</div>
	<div>Keep in mind that a typedef such as
	<div>
<pre class="code">
typedef struct MyStructure TMyStructure;
</pre>
	</div>
	still leads to the generation of the java class:
	<div>
<pre class="code">
class TMyStructure {
	
	public MyStructure value;
	
...
}
</pre>
	</div>
	</div></li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.0.7:</h2>

<p>You already guessed it: minor update/maintenance release.

<ul>

	<li><span>Fixed inheriting character encoding from TCP-based listening server transport
	to the child TCP-based server connection transports.</span></li>
	
	<li><span>Fixed/corrected behavior when registering server transports: an ONC/RPC exception
	with the reason <code>OncRpcException.RPC_CANNOTREGISTER</code> will now be thrown if the local portmapper
	denies port registration.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 1.0.6:</h2>

<p>This is again a minor update/maintenance release.

<ul>

  <li><span>Fixed encapsulation of properties when generating beans.</span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed miscalculation of remaining timeout, which could case
  infinite timeouts.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 1.0.5:</h2>

<p>This is a minor update/maintenance release.

<ul>

  <li><span>Fixed a code generation error in jrpcgen which cause the protocol
  compiler to emit ONC/RPC server code that did not properly returned errors for
  unsupported programs.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added new jrpcgen-test target to Ant build file so that the
  jrpcgen protocol compiler can be more easily tested on the example files.</span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed <code>build.xml</code> Ant script to include also exactly this
  build file in the source code zip which gets uploaded to Source Forge.</span></li>
  
</ul>


<h2>Version 1.0.4:</h2>

<p>It has been a long time since the previous release ... but yes, I finally
managed to pick up the patches sent and rolled them into the new release. Many
things changed in the meantime so I'm glad I got this release out of the door at
all. My new employer throws all kind of really interesting tasks at me, so
RemoteTea is now a really low profile project to me. If volunteers will step forward
to maintain RemoteTea I would be glad to welcome them aboard the RemoteTea
project.

<ul>

  <li><span>Added a new option <b><code>-bean</code></b> to <code>jrpcgen</code>
  for generating accessors (setters and getters)
  for all elements in a structure. Option <code>-bean</code> also implies
  <code>-ser</code>. This feature bases on a patch from Ralph Neff.</span></li>

  <li><span><code>jrpcgen</code> now also accepts .x files without a
  program section. In this case no stub classes are generated, but 
  Java source code files for all structures, enums, et cetera are still
  generated. This feature bases on a patch from Bialas Krzysztof.</span></li>

  <li><span>Updated to new CPU runtime, see also the
  <a href="http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/">CUP LALR Parser Generator in
  Java Version 11 at TU Munich</a>.</span></li>

  <li><span>Incorporated patches for: compile target in Ant build file, include Ant
  task in <code>jrpcgen.jar</code>.</span></li>

  <li><span>Thank you all who sent in patches!</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 1.0.3:</h2>

<p>This release marks my movement from the website of the good old
Chair of Process Control Engineering to Sourceforge. Since
<q>Remote Tea</q> has now quite some users, it was time to put the
project on its own feet. Let's see where this will lead to.</p>

<ul>

  <li><span>With my transition from JBuilder to Eclipse a little bit
  of rearrangement of a few files was necessary. In particular, the
  old JBuilder project files are gone down the bit bucket, so say
  <q>hello</q> to the new Eclipse project files. With the switch to
  Eclipse we now have a <em>free</em> IDE for a <em>free</em> ONC/RPC
  package &#x96; and if you use ClassPath and an appropriate VM, then
  the whole thing is <em>free</em>.</span></li>

  <li><span>Updated documentation &#x96; but you will probably already
  have noticed that from the new style of this and the other HTML
  files.</span></li>

  <li><span>Yet another small correction to <span
  class="product">jrpcgen</span>: it does not emit unnecessary import
  statements anymore. This silences especially the
  <q>Eclipse</q> IDE, but also other <q>smart asses</q>.</span></li>

  <li><span>It is now possible to optionally control the character
  encoding used when (de-)serializing strings. The <code>OncRpcClient</code>
  class now has a pair of accessors
  <code>setCharacterEncoding(<i>encoding</i>)</code> and
  <code>getCharacterEncoding()</code>. Similiar, <code>OncRpcServerStub</code>
  gives control over character encoding on the server side.</span></li>

</ul>

<h2>Version 1.0.2:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Fixed a bug in <span class="product">jrpcgen</span>, which
  caused the automatically generated constructor in server stubs,
  which accepts a port number, to ignore this port number.</span></li>

  <li><span>Also squashed a bug which caused problems when definitions
  from enumerations where used as program numbers.</span></li>

  <li><span>Small <q>todo</q> work done, so that <span
  class="product">jrpcgen</span> now emits more useful information in
  the javadoc tags for remote procedure parameters and
  results.</span></li>

  <li><span>Removed old and useless code from <span
  class="product">jrpcgen</span> that has alread been commented out
  for quite some time.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added new parameter <span class="arg">-withcallinfo</span>
  to <span class="product">jrpcgen</span>. When specified on the
  command line, <span class="product">jrpcgen</span> emits server
  method stubs which contain always as their first parameter an
  additional parameter holding information about the remote call
  itself.  This can be used, for instance, for authentication
  purposes, et cetera.  The parameter is always named
  <code>call$</code> and of type
  <code>OncRpcCallInformation</code>.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added new parameter <span class="arg">-noclamp</span> to
  <span class="product">jrpcgen</span>. When <span
  class="arg">-noclamp</span> is specified on the command line, <span
  class="product">jrpcgen</span> emits client method stubs which use
  the version number specified when creating the client object at
  runtime. When this option is not given, <span
  class="product">jrpcgen</span> defaults to the current behavior and
  uses the version number as specified in the x-file.</span></li>

</ul>

<h2>Version 1.0.1:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Fixed a bug in <span class="product">jrpcgen</span>, which
  emitted wrong stub code when a remote function contained more than
  one parameter: in this case, enumerations were not properly coerced
  to integers (thanks to Michael Smith for pointing this out and at
  the same time supplying the patch).</span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed another bug in <span class="product">jrpcgen</span>,
  which resulted in some (enumeration) constants not being
  dumped.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 1.0.0:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Tired of all the pre-1.0 releases in the past two years, I
  finally decided to go straight to the official 1.0 release. The past
  releases were primarily aiming at feature completeness to some
  degree, while the real basic parts were quite stable (with few
  improvements and bug fixes) over time. So, ... <b>we have reached
  1.0!</b> ...and will probably soon get to 1.0.x, sigh.</span></li>

  <li><span>For XDR structs with tail references to themselves, <span
  class="product">jrpcgen</span> now emits serialization and
  deserialization code which uses an iteration loop instead of tail
  recursion. The benefit of this is that the call stack usage is
  considerably reduced. Of course, this optimization can only be
  applied if the reference to the same type is the <em>last</em>
  element of the structure.</span></li>

  <li><span>Corrected a race condition, which sometimes caused the
  listening TCP thread in ONC/RPC servers to die with
  <code>NullPointerExceptions</code>. Many thanks to Michael Smith for
  hunting down this one. Classes concerned are
  <code>OncRpcTcpConnectionServerTransport</code>,
  <code>OncRpcTcpServerTransport</code> and
  <code>OncRpcUdpServerTransport</code>.</span></li>

  <li><span><span class="product">jrpcgen</span> now exits the VM with
  a non-zero return code in case it was called through its static
  <code>main</code> and <span class="product">jrpcgen</span> stumbled
  on an error. This allows <span class="product">jrpcgen</span> to be
  used in classic make projects. The Apache Ant is not affected by
  this behavior.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added an additional constructor to the classes
  <code>OncRpcTcpServerTransport</code> and
  <code>OncRpcUdpServerTransport</code>. It accepts now a local
  binding address.  The server socket is then bound only to this/these
  local address(es).  In addition, <span
  class="product">jrpcgen</span> now emits source code for server
  stubs with an additional constructor which accepts the additional
  binding address.</span></li>

</ul>

<h2>Version 0.95.2:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Small change in
  <code>OncRpcTcpSocketHelper.connect()</code> to accept a negative
  timeout that signals to use the particular implementation-specific
  timeout value.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added new constructor to <code>OncRpcTcpClient</code>,
  which accepts a timeout parameter (in milliseconds) as its last
  argument. This constructor can be used to limit the connection
  attempt period and finally makes the timeout functionality available
  which has been implemented in the 0.95.1 release.  It is important
  to note that the timeout specified as the parameter to the
  constructor does not apply to later ONC/RPC calls. These are
  controlled as usual through the existing timeout-related
  accessors.</span></li>

  <li><span>Made <code>OncRpcPortmapClient</code> a stand-alone class,
  which is not derived from <code>OncRpcUdpClient</code> any
  more. This now allows applications to contact the portmapper either
  using UDP/IP or TCP/IP (HTTP not yet supported).</span></li>

  <li><span>Bumped up the versioning information in
  <code>OncRpcConstants</code> (I had forgotten to do so for the
  previous releases...).</span></li>

</ul>

<h2>Version 0.95.1:</h2>

<p>After a long time (and a Ph.D. thesis on metamodelling for
communication in operational process control engineering now written
and on its way) I've finally managed to get a new RemoteTea release
out of the door.</p>

<ul>

  <li><span>Implemented timeout-controlled connects for TCP-based
  ONC/RPC clients.  The whole thing is a little bit tricky in view of
  pre-1.4&nbsp;JREs. However, I definitely want to support
  JDK&nbsp;1.2 and 1.3 (so much for write once, forget
  everywhere).

  <p>The socket helper object features a <code>connect</code> method
  which can execute timeout-controlled connection establishment. In
  case the current VM Remote Tea is running on does not provide a
  proper implementation, Remote Tea resorts to the following
  algorithm:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><span>The <code>connect</code> method creates a new thread
    which in turn tries to connect to the given port at the given host
    (an instance of the local class <code>Connectiator</code> is
    responsible for this).</span></li>

    <li><span>The original thread initiating the Connectiator thread
    now waits for it to finish, but no longer than the timeout
    specified in the call to the <code>connect</code> method. In case
    the Connectiator does not succeed within the timeout period, an
    <code>IOException</code> is thrown by the <code>connect</code>
    method.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Connectiator object will signal itself in case it
    succeeded, but also if it failed. Its <code>getIOException</code>
    method then either returns <code>null</code> or an
    <code>IOException</code>.</span></li>

  </ul>

  </span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed deserializing bug in
  <code>XdrDecodingStream.xdrDecodeLong()</code>, where unwanted sign
  extension messed up 64&nbsp;bit wide integers (XDR hypers).</span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed a long-standing <q>feature</q> in
  <code>XdrTcpDecodingStream.fill()</code>, which caused invalid
  header decoding if the fragment length was larger than
  2<sup>27</sup>.</span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed sanity checks for those ONC/RPC partners sending
  empty XDR fragments as last fragments of XDR records &#x96; a trailing
  last XDR fragment that carries no data is now accepted. The fix
  concerns the class <code>XdrTcpDecodingStream</code> semantics of
  the <code>fill</code> method were slightly changed to return also in
  case of empty trailing record (<code>lastFragment</code> attribute
  must be <code>true</code>). All methods directly calling
  <code>fill</code> have been adapted (at least I hope
  so).</span></li>

  <li><span>Improved handling of wrong or mismatching ONC/RPC messages
  for UDP-based ONC/RPC clients. They do not emit new calls any more
  when receiving replies from wrong sources and keep quiet instead
  until the timeout expires (as per current timeout
  strategy).</span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed some buffer offset bugs (forgot to take care of CRLF
  at one place) in <code>XdrHttpDecodingStream</code>, for which
  patches were kindly offered by the austrian internet
  chamoises.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added Ant task for <Span Class="Product">jrpcgen</Span> as
  <code>org.acplt.oncrpc.ant.JrpcgenTask</code>, kindly provided by
  Jean-Francois Daune.  This also involved some small changes to <span
  class="product">jrpcgen</span> in order to make it available as a
  task.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.94.2:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Fixed bug in <span class="product">jrpcgen</span>, which
  caused a crash when hashing a union's structure (needed to create
  serial version UIDs) and the union contained a non-empty default
  arm. Also added appropriate
  <q>test case</q> to <code>demo.x</code>.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.94.1:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Added two new code generation options to <span
  class="product">jrpcgen</span>:

  <ul>

    <li><span><span class="arg">-ser</span>: tag classes generated for
    XDR structs, XDR unions and XDR typedefs as serializable. Also
    automatically generates <code>serialVersionUID</code> using the
    SHA-1 algorithm. (My thanks to the <a class="ext"
    href="http://www.classpath.org">GNU classpath</a> project for
    providing the SHA-1 algorithm, please see
    <code>Jrpcgen.SHA.java</code> for license details).</span></li>

    <li><span><span class="arg">-initstrings</span>: automatically
    initialize all <code>Strings</code> as empty strings (""). Note
    that this may lead to lazy programming; better make explicitly
    sure that every member of a struct gets initialized properly
    before encoding the struct.</span></li>

  </ul>
  </span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.93.1:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Once more fixed support for JDK&nbsp;1.1 for Java-based
  ONC/RPC servers: the old code still used a LinkedList, which is only
  available since JDK&nbsp;1.2.  So I added a minimalist double linked
  list local class (it's in
  <code>OncRpcTcpServerTransport.TransportList</code>).</span></li>

  <li><span>Worked around some broken JDKs&nbsp;1.1 (especially on
  AIX, but I have also heard of problems on Linux), which have broken
  <code>InetAddress.getLocalHost</code>. The code now uses
  <code>InetAdress.getByName("127.0.0.1")</code>. Yeah, write once,
  does not work anywhere.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added overloaded <code>client.call</code> method which
  expects an additional (procedure/protocol) version number as its
  second argument. This method is necessary so several versions can
  coexists peacefully in one client and can be called
  simultaneously. As before, if you do not specify a version in the
  call to <code>client.call</code> the <q>default</q> version is used
  as specified in the constructor. Please note that
  <code>OncRpcClient</code>-derived classes must now implement the
  overloaded <code>call</code> method expecting four parameters:
  procedure number, version number, parameters, and result (this only
  applies to those who want to implement their own ONC/RPC clients for
  different transports than those already provided).</span></li>

  <li><span>Added support for multiple parameters in procedure
  declarations within x-files, to be more in sync with newer rpcgen
  releases. In addition, <span class="product">jrpcgen</span> now also
  accept named parameters in remote procedure declarations. Both
  enhancements caused quite some changes in the code emitting parts of
  <span class="product">jrpcgen</span>: local wrapper classes are used
  to serialize and deserialize multiple parameters.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.92.1:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Support for batched ONC/RPC calls when using TCP-based
  transports: see OncRpcTcpClient.batchCall() for more
  information.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added support for handling multiple ONC/RPC programs
  and/or versions through the same server transport.</span></li>

  <li><span><span class="product">jrpcgen</span> now emits a second
  constructor expecting the port number to bind transports to as its
  solely parameter. This allows server writers to bind their servers
  to well-known ports.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added a jportmap and an embedded portmap
  service class.  It can be used by standalone applications which
  should also be useable if the user has not installed a portmap
  service.  I must have been bored or insane. Or both.</span></li>

  <li><span>Made several <code>OncRpcServerStub</code> methods public
  (instead of protected), to give derived server classes more control
  over the way they spin up and down.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.91.2:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Ashes on my head for releasing 0.91.1 with a really dumb
  bug related to JDK&nbsp;1.1 backwards compatibility which broke JDK2
  compatibility completely.  When using reflection one can not call
  the superclass' methods for obvious reasons, so an endless recursion
  occured in <code>OncRpcTcpSocket</code>. So much for almost not
  testing the release. To fix this stupid design bug the classes
  <code>OncRpcTcpSocket</code> and <code>OncRpcUdpSocket</code> were
  moved to <code>OncRpcTcpSocketHelper</code> and
  <code>OncRpcUdpSocketHelper</code>. They now merely support
  <code>Socket</code> and <code>DatagramSocket</code> instead of
  inheriting from them. This avoids the endless reflection method
  invocation loop, but is still cheaper in terms of method invocation
  performance than a wrapper class.</span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed missing JDK&nbsp;1.1
  compatibility for the server classes.</span></li>

</ul>

<h2>Version 0.91.1:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Fixed a deserialization bug with <code>AUTH_NONE</code> on
  the server side in <code>OncRpcServerAuth.xdrNew</code> when
  recycling the <code>AUTH_NONE</code> handler singleton.</span></li>

  <li><span>Removed automatic startup from the constructor of <span
  class="product">jrpcgen</span> generated server stubs. The
  constructor of a server stub class now only creates the transport
  objects and sets the public <code>transports</code> field within
  class <code>OncRpcServerStub</code>. Registering with the portmapper
  as well as dispatching calls is now done within the
  <code>run()</code> method (note: without any parameters). You need
  to change your code accordingly by inserting a call to
  <code>run()</code>, otherwise the server will not start.

  <pre>
    MyServer myserver = new MyServer();
    myserver.run();
  </pre>
  </span></li>

  <li><span>Preparations for cvs check-in: in order to handle
  individual Java projects in form of cvs submodules within the
  toplevel cvs module <q>java</q>, some files were moved. The JBuilder
  project files have been moved to the <code>projects/</code>
  subdirectory.</span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed problem with <span class="product">jrpcgen</span>
  emitting constants which depend on other constants in wrong
  order. Constants which are needed by other constant definitions are
  now emitted first. In case an enumeration element depends on a
  global constant (or for some reason on another enumeration element),
  then the enclosure is taken into account too. The
  <code>demo.x</code> example now tests some pathological
  cases.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added backward support for JDK&nbsp;1.1. While I'm not
  very proud of it, many people requested this as quite some companies
  use the bug-ridden MS&nbsp;InternetExploder with its very own
  JVM. Changes include using <code>addElement</code> instead of
  <code>add</code> when adding objects to a
  <code>Vector</code>.</span></li>

  <li><span>Moved the readme documentation into its own directory
  <code>readme-first/</code> which should be more obvious to
  first-time users of the RemoteTea source code and does not clobber
  the <code>projects/</code> directory any more.</span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed <code>NullPointerException</code> in
  <code>OncRpcTcpClient</code> and <code>OncRpcUdpClient</code> when
  checking for rejected credentials &#x96; and I thought Java had no
  pointers.</span></li>

  <li><span><span class="product">jrpcgen</span>: support for short
  form <code>unsigned</code> in addition to <code>unsigned int</code>
  (compatibility with <code>rpcgen</code>). Handling of octal numbers
  added (okay, it is still a valid number format). Fixed bug in the
  code generation of desciminated unions using booleans. Support for
  more than one program definition within the same x-file.  In this
  case the source code files generated for the client and server stubs
  are named
  <i>&lt;x-filename&gt;&lt;program-id&gt;</i><code>Client.java</code>
  and
  <i>&lt;x-filename&gt;&lt;program-id&gt;</i><code>Server.java</code>,
  respectively.</span></li>

  <li><span>First rough cut for tunneling ONC/RPC client calls through
  HTTP connections. On the other end, you will need the <q>Tea
  Tunnel</q> Apache DSO module, which <q>untunnels</q> calls and
  forwards them to the appropriate ONC/RPC server using direct TCP/IP
  or UDP/IP connections (or non-connections in the case of
  UDP/IP).</span></li>

  <li><span>Added new package <code>org.acplt.oncrpc.web</code>
  containing helper classes for HTTP client connections
  (<code>HttpClientConnection</code>), and base64 encoding and
  decoding (<code>Base64</code>), as well as some other
  stuff.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added new class <code>OncRpcHttpClient</code>, which
  stands in the tradition of <code>OncRpcClient</code> and implements
  sending ONC/RPC calls through HTTP tunnels. Also added
  <code>XdrHttpDecodingStream</code>, which can pull base64 encoded
  data from a web server and provide the decoded data through the
  usual decoding XDR stream interface.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.90.1:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Fixed
  <code>XdrEncodingStream.xdrEncodeByteFixedVector()</code> which
  falsely encoded length information about the following array of
  characters.  I should take more care when doing <code>Italian code
  recycling</code> using copy &amp; pasta...</span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed bug in <code>OncRpcTcpClient.call()</code> which
  caused XDR buffer underflows when receiving the next reply after the
  previous reply has been rejected by an ONC/RPC server.</span></li>

  <li><span>Updated package.html for package
  <code>org.acplt.oncrpc</code> to put it in sync with (de-)
  serializing fixed-size vectors and dynamic and fixed vectors of
  characters.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added <code>AUTH_UNIX</code> authentication. For this to
  achieve quite some additions and changes were necessary &#x96;
  luckily, old applications will not be broken, as the changes are
  deep within the RemoteTea package:

  <ul>

    <li><span>See OncRpcClient for a description about how to use
    authentication with ONC/RPC clients.</span></li>

    <li><span>For handling of client-side authentication issues, the
    classes <code>OncRpcClientAuth</code>,
    <code>OncRpcClientAuthNone</code> and
    <code>OncRpcClientAuthUnix</code> were added.</span></li>

    <li><span>The ONC/RPC call and reply message classes
    <code>OncRpcReplyMessage</code> and <code>OncRpcCallMessage</code>
    are now both abstract. This was necessary because ONC/RPC protocol
    issues make it necessary to handle authentication through
    so-called authentication protocol handling objects different on
    the client side than on the server side.  Additional classes now
    handle sending calls and receiving replies on the client side
    (<code>OncRpcClientCallMessage</code> and
    <code>OncRpcClientReplyMessage</code> respectively), as well as on
    the server side (<code>OncRpcServerCallMessage</code> and
    <code>OncRpcServerReplyMessage</code>). According to their needs,
    these new classes only declare those encoding and decoding methods
    which are really needed. In consequence, the base class
    <code>OncRpcCallMessage</code> has lost its <code>XdrAble</code>
    interface completely.</span></li>

    <li><span>Added authentication handling and credential refreshing
    to <code>OncRpcUdpClient</code> and <code>OncRpcTcpClient</code>,
    as well as to the base class
    <code>OncRpcClient</code>.</span></li>

    <li><span>Added authentication protocol handling to ONC/RPC
    transports. If servers want to take advantage of authentication,
    they need to look at the <code>callMessage.auth</code> attribute
    of the <code>OncRpcCallInformation</code> delivered with each
    incomming ONC/RPC call. See
    <code>tests.org.acplt.oncrpc.ServerTest.java</code> for an
    example.</span></li>

  </ul>

  Please note that <code>AUTH_DES</code> is still not supported, as
  this needs quite some things to be done and I don't have full
  information about the <code>AUTH_DES</code> protocol.

  </span></li>

  <li><span>Added new classes <code>XdrBufferEncodingStream</code> and
  <code>XdrBufferDecodingStream</code> for encoding and decoding XDR
  data from and to a fixed-size buffer. These classes comes in handy
  when dealing with shorthand credentials.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added class <code>XdrDynamicOpaque</code> to handle
  variable-sized vectors of bytes.</span></li>

  <li><span>Moved the <span class="product">jrpcgen</span> package to
  <code>org.acplt.oncrpc.apps.jrpcgen</code>, because it's an
  application belonging very tight to ONC/RPC.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added new
  <code>OncRpcConstants.REMOTETEA_VERSION_PREVERSION</code>, which
  indicates preversions if not zero.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.86.1:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>As Sun's rpcgen encodes <code>char&lt;></code> as a
  series of characters, each one sitting happily in its very own XDR
  int (that is, four bytes), the two methods
  <code>XdrDecodingStream.xdrDecodeBytes()</code> and
  <code>XdrEncodingStream.xdrEncodeBytes()</code> were renamed to
  <code>XdrDecodingStream.xdrDecodeByteVector()</code> and
  <code>XdrEncodingStream.xdrEncodeByteVector()</code> as well as
  their semantics changed accordingly.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added methods
  <code>XdrDecodingStream.xdrDecodeDynamicOpaque()</code>,
  <code>XdrEncodingStream.xdrEncodeDynamicOpaque()</code>,
  <code>XdrDecodingStream.xdrDecodeByteFixedVector()</code> and
  <code>XdrEncodingStream.xdrEncodeByteFixedVector()</code>.</span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed <span class="product">jrpcgen</span> accordingly, so
  it generates proper code for arrays of bytes and opaque data types
  accordingly.</span></li>

  <li><span>Made all non-abstract encoding and decoding methods in
  <code>XdrDecodingStream</code> and <code>XdrEncodingStream</code>
  finally <code>final</code>. Maybe this helps Java compilers improve
  code speed. Maybe.</span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed <span class="product">jrpcgen</span> code generation
  error when the size of an array was specified using a constant
  identifier. Now <span class="product">jrpcgen</span> properly
  references the constant from the x-file's main class.</span></li>

  <li><span>Fixed some documentation errors for
  <code>XdrDecodingStream</code> and
  <code>XdrEncodingStream</code>.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.85.1:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Added new method <code>readBuffer()</code> to class
  <code>XdrTcpDecodingStream</code>. This fixes problems when reading
  from a TCP/IP stream and not all bytes wanted are immediately
  available, thus <code>stream.read()</code> returning not all bytes
  at once (shame on me for not reading the java.io documentation
  attentive enough).</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.84.1:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Added control over the retransmission strategy used by
  UDP/IP-based ONC/RPC clients. The default strategy is now not to
  resend lost ONC/RPC calls (retransmission timeout is set to the
  overall timeout). Either a fixed retransmission timeout can be
  choosen, where lost calls are resend every &lt;retransmission
  timeout> milliseconds, or an exponential back-off alogorithm. The
  exponential scheme starts with the retransmission timeout and
  doubles it every time a call is lost, until the overall timeout is
  reached.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added two more constructors to ONC/RPC clients generated
  by <span class="product">jrpcgen</span> from x-files. These
  constructors now also accept the remote program number, so
  application writers gain full control.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.83.1:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Fixed support for indirection in decriminated unions. Also
  cleaned up some minor things related to constants and
  enumerations. Thanks to Ulrik Sandberg for throwing all kinds of
  vicious x-files at <span class="product">jrpcgen</span>.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.82.1:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Added support for indirection in x-files, also called
  <q>optional data</q> in ONC/RPC babble. Also added a new test case
  to the demo.x file.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.81.1:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Added broadcasting of ONC/RPC calls to UDP/IP-based
  ONC/RPC clients through the new <code>broadcastCall</code> of method
  in class <code>OncRpcUdpClient</code>.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added helper methods for encoding and decoding fixed-size
  vectors for various base data types.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added a description about mapping rpcgen (RFC&nbsp;1832)
  data types to Java data type.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added an RPC protocol compiler named <span
  class="product">jrpcgen</span>. Sun's documentation on the rpcgen
  syntax and grammar is rather thin and sometimes inaccurate. As
  always, I had to resort to RTSL (<q>Read The Source, Luke!</q>) to
  find out what syntax and grammar rpcgen does in fact use. Please
  give it a try and report problems. Note that there is no
  preprocessor step.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.80.2:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Fixed a buffer underflow exception in XdrUdpDecodingStream
  in methods <code>xdrDecodeOpaque(int)</code> and
  <code>xdrDecodeOpaque(byte[],int,int)</code>. This cures the bug
  where a XDR string being the last piece of information in a RPC call
  or reply could not be read successfully.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added <code>org.acplt.oncrpc.OncRpcConstants</code>, which
  contains versioning information.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.80.1:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Separated the ONC/RPC package under the name <q>Remote
  Tea</q> from the ACPLTea package. As the ONC/RPC implementation is
  pretty functional the version number was changed to reflect
  this.</span></li>

  <li><span>Added XDR primitive and serializable data types for
  strings, floats, etc.</span></li>

</ul>


<h2>Version 0.35.1 and before:</h2>
<ul>

  <li><span>Graciously hidden in the mist of history (probably also in
  the midst of history). The Remote Tea package was then only
  available together with the ACPLTea package, but not
  separate.</span></li>

</ul>
